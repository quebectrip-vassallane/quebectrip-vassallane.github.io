            The Vassal Lane French students are taking a trip to Quebec City
            Saturday from April 13 until Tuesday April 16, 2019.
          </p>
  
          <p>
              It is an expensive trip and we are planning some fundraising to  
              assist a few families that otherwise wouldn't be able to go and
              bring down the cost for everyone.
              
              We set a goal of raising $6000 to support lowering the cost of the trip.  
  
              Here is a summary of the fundraising events we are organizing to help lower 
              the costs of the French Trip to Quebec.  
              I hope everyone can find a way to be part of an event in the upcoming months.    
              There are a few families who have requested specific levels of financial aid 
              but we recognized that the trip is expensive, so we hope to bring down the costs for everyone.

          <h3>How can I help?</h3>

            <b>The Silent Auction.</b>   
            This takes place on Wednesday, January 23rd at Arts Night in room 322.  
            We have two items donated at this time to auction off and <b>could use a few more</b>.  
            Consider reaching out to businesses you know and asking for a donation.  
            We can share a Google Form with you avoid multiple requests to the same businesses.
            
            Also donâ€™t forget to stop by and bid on an item !
          </p>
            
          <p>
            <b>Bake Sale</b>   
            We are also hosting a bake sale at the Arts Night.  
            Mme Laura will recruit student volunteers to help sell things across the evening, 
            but we really need parents to provide the food and drinks that we could sell.  
            You can get out your baking pans or take a trip to Costco!  
            
            <a href="mailto:noragrodzins@gmail.com">Nora Grodzins (noragrodzins@gmail.com)</a>  has agreed to coordinate this event.  
            She will be need parent volunteers to help supervise the Bake Sale for part of the time.  
            This event will be a great way for student to get involved.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            <b>Raffle</b>  
            We will hold a raffle starting in February.  
            Kim Bernstein has volunteered to coordinate this. 
            We hope to see students involved in helping to sell the tickets. 
            
            This website will be a key portal for coordinating this event.
          </p>

            <b>Cocktail Party</b> 
            Finally we are planning a Cocktail Party at Rachel Cobb's home.  
            This will be in mid March with exact date and time to be determined.  
            
            More information to come.

            <b>Donations</b>
            If you are connected to a generous corporation or business who would like to make a 
            large scale donation that would be great.
            Friends of VLUS has agreed to accept larger donations for the trip (which would be tax deductible).  
            Be sure they write "Quebec Trip" on the memo line.
