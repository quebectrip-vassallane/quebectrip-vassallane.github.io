          The Vassal Lane French students are taking a trip to Quebec City
          Saturday from April 13 until Tuesday April 16, 2019 which is
          <span id="days-counter"></span> days from now.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is an expensive trip and we are planning some fundraising to assist
          a few families that otherwise wouldn't be able to go and bring down
          the cost for everyone. We set a goal of raising $6000 to support
          lowering the cost of the trip. Here is a summary of the fundraising
          events we are organizing to help lower the costs of the French Trip to
          Quebec. I hope everyone can find a way to be part of an event in the
          upcoming months. There are a few families who have requested specific
          levels of financial aid but we recognized that the trip is expensive,
          so we hope to bring down the costs for everyone.

          <p>
            Was a great success! The kids did a great, enthusiastic job
            interacting with our customers. They really owned the project and
            deserve a lot of credit for their hard work. Thank you everyone for
            pitching in and making the night so fun.

            We have two items donated at this time to auction off and

            be a key portal for coordinating this event.

          <b>Donations</b> If you are connected to a generous corporation or
          business who would like to make a large scale donation that would be
          great. Friends of VLUS has agreed to accept larger donations for the
          trip (which would be tax deductible). Be sure they write "Quebec Trip"
          on the memo line.
